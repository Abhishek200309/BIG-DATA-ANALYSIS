# Description

This project analyzes a large movie ratings dataset using PySpark, demonstrating how to handle, clean, and analyze big data efficiently. The analysis includes exploring average ratings by genre, top movies, rating distribution, and popular genres at multiple dataset scales. The results are exported as an HTML report for easy visualization.

Key features of this project:

 - Efficient handling of large datasets using PySpark.

 - Exploding multi-genre movies into individual rows for accurate genre-based analysis.

 - Analysis performed on different dataset sizes (100,000 rows, 500,000 rows, and full dataset) to compare performance.

 - HTML report generation for all major metrics, including tables for:

    - Average rating by genre

    - Top 5 movies

    - Rating distribution

    - Most popular genres

# Requirements

 - Python 3.8+

 - PySpark (pip install pyspark)

 - pandas (pip install pandas)

 - Web browser for viewing the HTML report

# Dataset

The dataset should be a CSV file with at least the following columns:

 - User_Id – Unique identifier for the user

 - Movie_Name – Name of the movie

 - Genre – Pipe-separated list of genres (e.g., Action|Comedy)

 - Rating – Numeric rating given by the user

# Output

The HTML report contains:

 - Dataset size and time taken for analysis

 - Mean and standard deviation of ratings

 - Average rating by genre

 - Top 5 movies by rating
